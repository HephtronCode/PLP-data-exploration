# OWID COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
This project analyzes COVID-19 data from the **Our World in Data (OWID)** dataset. It explores trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries, with a focus on identifying key insights, anomalies, and patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and reporting to provide actionable insights.

## Objectives
- To analyze COVID-19 trends across selected countries (e.g., Belgium, Yemen, Zambia).
- To identify key patterns, such as vaccination progress and death rates.
- To highlight data anomalies and provide recommendations for improving data quality.
- To visualize trends using line charts, bar charts, and other visual tools.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization (e.g., heatmaps).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and reporting.

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd owid-data-analysis-project
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook owid-covid.ipynb
   ```
5. Run the notebook cells sequentially to view the analysis and visualizations.

## Insights and Reflections
### Key Insights
1. **Vaccination Rollout**: Belgium had the fastest vaccine rollout among the selected countries.
2. **Death Rate**: Yemen exhibited the highest death rate, indicating severe pandemic impact.
3. **Data Gaps**: Significant gaps in vaccination and testing data were observed, particularly in developing countries.
4. **Trends**: Seasonal trends in cases and deaths were identified, with peaks during colder months.

### Reflections
- The analysis highlights the importance of consistent and complete data reporting for effective pandemic management.
- Visualizations provide a clear understanding of trends and anomalies, aiding in decision-making.
- Future work could include expanding the analysis to more countries and incorporating additional datasets (e.g., economic or healthcare data).
